Learn to build React applications that manage and persist data from the data relationships found in real world applications. In this course, Building Essential UI Data Elements in React 17, you’ll learn to build front-end browser-based user interfaces. First, you’ll explore the three most common data relationship scenarios used when building React applications. Next, you’ll discover how to build a client-only version using those relationships. Finally, you’ll learn how to build a complete backend in Node that supports persisting the data from all three relationships, through a REST server built in Node, and persisting back through the Prisma ORM to SQLite. When you are finished with the course, you’ll have the skills and knowledge necessary to build real world React applications that manage typical data scenarios found in website projects including enterprise applications.
